	// The first one, called Team, has a field for the name of the team and a field for the player names.
	// The second type is called League and has a field called Teams for the teams in the league and a field called Wins that maps a teamâ€™s name to its number of wins.

	// ex2:
	// Add two methods to League. The first method is called MatchResult.
	// It takes four parameters: the name of the first team, its score in the game, the name of the second team, and its score in the game.
	// This method should update the Wins field in League. Add a second method to League called Ranking that returns a slice of the team names in order of wins.
	// Build your data structures and call these methods from the main function in your program using some sample data.

	// ex3:
	// Define an interface called Ranker that has a single method called Ranking that returns a slice of strings.
	// Write a function called RankPrinter with two parameters, the first of type Ranker and the second of type io.Writer.
	// Use the io.WriteString function to write the values returned by Ranker to the io.Writer, with a newline separating each result.
	// Call this function from main.
