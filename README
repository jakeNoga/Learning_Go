This workspace was originally me just following Learing Go, 2nd Edition by Jon Bodner. After completing most of the 
book. I started to continue to use this workspace to model things and learn things in a isolated environment. Thus
far the project go_c_server_client is my most complected.

go_c_server_client
    - C client (created a c client that calls a c library that uses a go lib)
        - c library
            -go library
                - Uses grpc to make calls to the go server

    - go server (the go code uses grpc to receive the call and calls a function written in c)
        - grpc
        - c function
